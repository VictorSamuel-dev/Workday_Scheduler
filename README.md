# Workday_Scheduler

## Description

Created a schedule for workday hours (between 9 AM and 5pm) that allows users to input a task in a time slot. Time slots in the past are listed in gray, the current time slot is listed in red, and future time slots are listed in green. This allows the user to see what time slots are available for them to schedule or prioritize their tasks.
